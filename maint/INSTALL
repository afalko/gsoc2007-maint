Follow these instructions if you do not intend to 
use the ebuild.

1) Run:
	make install

2) If you want to use sqlite (which I recommend), 
run:
	make sqlite

3) Move /etc/tsk.conf.example:
	cp tsk.conf.example tsk.conf

4) Edit tsk.conf by following the 
comments in there.

5) If you want to use mysql or another database 
run:
	tsk-db-manage 

6) Copy the "web/" directory to where your would 
like it to be. Configure your apache to have 
the following: 

<Directory "path/to/web/directory">
	AllowOverride All
</Directory>

7) Inside your web/ directory run:
cp htaccess .htaccess

8) As root, run tsk-daemon

9) If the interface is not usable, then you have 
to change permissions to the files in /var/db/tsk 
and /var/run/tsk to be readable by your apache 
user.
