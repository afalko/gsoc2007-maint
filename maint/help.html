<center><H2>Introduction</H2></center><p>
Tsk is an interface that enables the developers of a project to determine which tasks are more 
important in users' and other developers' eyes. The interface also gives users the ability to 
bring attention to tasks they would like to see accomplished. Tsk also allows developers and 
users to see and set the current status of tasks. Users can set four different task statuses: <br>
<li>Reported</li>
<li>Working</li>
<li>Abandoned</li>
<li>CommitReady</li><br><p>
Developers have access to two more statuses:<br>
<li>Committing</li>
<li>Committed</li><p>

<center><H2>Registering and Logging In</H2></center><p>
Users who have not registered and logged in cannot vote, change the status of tasks, or add 
tasks. To register, you need to supply your email and password of your choosing. If you 
provided the correct email address, you will receive an email with a verification code. Copy 
and paste this code into the <a href="verify.cgi">verification form</a>. Once you verify 
your email, you will be able to login to the interface. <p>

<center><H2>Voting</H2></center><p>
Users and developers both have equal voting abilities. Everyone starts out with 50 points. These 
50 points can be used to add votes to any task. The more votes a task receives, the higher up on 
the task list it gets. If a task is too high, people can subtract voting points from it to lower 
its position in the list. Here are some simple rules by which voting works: <br>
<li>The points added to a task that gets committed are added back to the voters.</li>
<li>On a weekly basis, voters with less than 50 points, get their points reset to 50.</li>
<li>No user can add or subtract more points than he has available.</li><p>

<center><H2>Statuses</H2></center><p>
The following statuses are, and should be, set for the following reasons: <br>
<li>Reported: When a task is submitted, it is given the reported status. Knowledge of the task's 
existence has been provided.</li>
<li>Working: A user marks a task as working if, and only if, they are working on the task. This 
is designed to signal to others that working being done and that they will should not bother doing 
duplicate work.</li>
<li>Abandoned: If a task is marked working for more than three days, it automatically becomes marked 
as abandoned. The assumption is that someone marked it working and forgot about the task. Users can 
also mark tasks abandoned if they think work has been been stopped for a task. </li>
<li>CommitReady: Once a user is finished working on a task and wants a developer to consider their 
work for committal, they mark can mark a task as ready to commit. This status help developers looking 
for finished work to test and commit.</li>
<li>Committing: A developer sets this when he is in the process of testing and committing an allegedly 
completed task. This status signals to other developers that they should not do duplicate work.</li>
<li>Committed: A developer marks a task to this status once he has tested and committed a task. 
This is equivalent to closing a task. All committed tasks are deleted from the task list after some 
time.</li><p>

<center><H2>Adding a Task</H2></center><p>
You can add a task by clicking the <a href="addtask.cgi">add task</a> button on the top left of 
task list table. Write a short description of the task and associate it with a web link that 
points to a detailed description of the task. This detailed description is usually an existing 
bug report, a thread in a forum, or a mailing list discussion. For your convenience you may enter 
a <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a> bug number for <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org">
Gentoo's bugzilla</a> instead of having to fish for the full link. <p>

<center><H2>Modifying a Task</H2></center><p>
After adding a task, you may modify your task's description, link, or both. Users can modify only 
their own tasks. Developers may modify any tasks.

<center><H2>Removing a Task</H2></center><p>
You may delete any tasks you have submitted. Developers may delete tasks submitted by others.
